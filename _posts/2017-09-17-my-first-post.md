excerpt: Is this working?
---

I have no interest in the stock market. I can almost say I dislike it more than I like it. I tend to dislike things I don't understand and that's part of the reason I'm writing this, to get help understanding.

In the era of automated descisions through data analysis (AI, machine learning, deep learning, whatever) it's beyond my understanding that people can make money trading stocks looking at motheracking dojis, candlesticks, triangles, conducting manual quantitative research. Or rather, if those people have any kind of success trading imagine the upside. I know that computers and their automated procedures has been trading for a long time but I don't understand how people manually looking at dojis, trends etc. can make a profit, are they?


What I do like about it is that it's generating a lot of data, and that a successful prediction really pays off.



It's Wednesday morning, the Stock Exchange just opened and the opening price is set. Everything to the left of that point is history and known. Everything to the right together with today (except the opening price) is the future and what we want to successfully guess.

Ultimately what we want to do is to separate these outcomes, i.e. up, down, natural, and that can only be done using what we know before that point in time.
