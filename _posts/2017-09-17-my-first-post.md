title: Stock Exchange | After 3 days decline you should buy
# categories: jekyll update
excerpt: Is this working?
---

In the era of automated descisions through data analysis (AI, machine learning, deep learning, whatever) it's beyond my understanding that people can make money trading stocks looking at dojis, candlesticks, triangles, conducting manual quantitative research. Or rather, if those people have any kind of success trading imagine the upside. I know that computers and their automated procedures have been trading for a long time but what I don't understand is how people that say 

>After 3 days decline you should buy

can make a profit. That quote is something I heard on a podcast, half joke half serious, from professional day traders. Another thing I heard was 

>I'm following the roulette principle, it has now been 13 days on black, one red day should come

This time unfortunately not a joke and I hope they'll stay away from the casino.

There's a lot of these kind of truths flying around which is what I believe a product of "Look and you will find it-behaviour". You'll identify and react to the outcome only when the theories are fulfilled and there's your fuel to the fire. I can admit that I've been a victim as well, thinking that if a stock opens with a big drop it will increase during the day due to an overreaction, but at the same time I don't believe it, it's too easy. The data is avaliable, so why not test it?

It's Wednesday morning, the Stock Exchange just opened and the opening price is set. Everything to the left of that
point is history and known. Everything to the right together with today (except the opening price) is the future and
what we want to successfully guess.

Making our closing price guess by looking at the potential overreaction I mentioned earlier,


Ultimately what we want to do is to separate these outcomes, i.e. up, down, natural, and that can only be done using
what we know before that point in time.
