I have no interest in the stock market. I can almost say I dislike it more than I like it. I don't understand how people 


What I do like about it is that it's generating a lot of data, and that a successful prediction really pays off.


Ultimately what we want to do is to separate these outcomes, i.e. up, down, natural, and that can only be done using what we know before that point in time.
