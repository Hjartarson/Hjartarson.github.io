title: Stock Exchange | After 3 days decline you should buy
# categories: jekyll update
excerpt: Is this working?
---

In the era of automated descisions through data analysis (AI, machine learning, deep learning, whatever) it's beyond my understanding that people can make money trading stocks looking at dojis, candlesticks, triangles, conducting manual quantitative research. Or rather, if those people have any kind of success trading imagine the upside. I know that computers and their automated procedures has been trading for a long time but what I don't understand is how people that say _"After 3 days decline you should buy"_ can make a profit.


What I do like about it is that it's generating a lot of data, and that a successful prediction really pays off.



It's Wednesday morning, the Stock Exchange just opened and the opening price is set. Everything to the left of that point is history and known. Everything to the right together with today (except the opening price) is the future and what we want to successfully guess.

Ultimately what we want to do is to separate these outcomes, i.e. up, down, natural, and that can only be done using what we know before that point in time.
